  <h1>10 Reasons People Oppose Universal Healthcare (And Why They're Wrong)</h1>

  <section>
    <div class="reason">
      <h3>1. "It will raise taxes."</h3>
      <p><span class="label">Concern:</span> Universal healthcare will require higher taxes to fund.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Counter:</span> While taxes may increase, individuals would no longer pay premiums, copays, or deductibles — which are often more expensive overall. The total cost per person would likely decrease under a universal system.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Evidence:</span> A study by the Political Economy Research Institute found that Medicare for All could save the U.S. approximately $5 trillion over a decade by reducing administrative costs and negotiating drug prices. <a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/fact-check-medicare-for-all-would-save-the-u-s-trillions-public-option-would-leave-millions-uninsured-not-garner-savings/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="reason">
      <h3>2. "It reduces the quality of care."</h3>
      <p><span class="label">Concern:</span> Government-run healthcare leads to worse outcomes.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Counter:</span> Countries with universal systems often have equal or better outcomes than the U.S. in areas like life expectancy and disease prevention.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Evidence:</span> The U.S. performs worse in long-term health outcomes measures, such as life expectancy and maternal mortality, compared to other developed countries. <a href="https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/quality-u-s-healthcare-system-compare-countries/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="reason">
      <h3>3. "There will be longer wait times."</h3>
      <p><span class="label">Concern:</span> Patients will face delays under universal care.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Counter:</span> The U.S. already experiences delays. Universal systems often prioritize by need and maintain timely access for urgent care.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Evidence:</span> A report by the Center for American Progress indicates that universal coverage need not increase wait times and discusses policy solutions to mitigate any impact. <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/truth-wait-times-universal-coverage-systems/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="reason">
      <h3>4. "It’s socialist, and socialism doesn’t work."</h3>
      <p><span class="label">Concern:</span> Government healthcare is socialism and leads to failure.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Counter:</span> Public services like schools and Medicare are also "socialist." Universal healthcare doesn't abolish capitalism — it ensures basic human rights.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Evidence:</span> Many capitalist countries, such as Germany and the UK, successfully implement universal healthcare systems. <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2019/universal-health-coverage-eight-countries" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="reason">
      <h3>5. "It will stifle innovation."</h3>
      <p><span class="label">Concern:</span> Private markets drive innovation, not government.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Counter:</span> Much innovation is publicly funded through the NIH. Universal systems still support strong medical research and development.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Evidence:</span> NIH funding contributed to published research associated with every one of the 210 new drugs approved by the FDA between 2010 and 2016. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1715368115" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="reason">
      <h3>6. "People should be responsible for their own health."</h3>
      <p><span class="label">Concern:</span> Universal care rewards unhealthy behavior.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Counter:</span> Many factors affecting health are outside personal control. Denying care on moral grounds is unjust and economically short-sighted.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Evidence:</span> Socioeconomic factors significantly influence health outcomes, and universal healthcare can help mitigate these disparities. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000844" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="reason">
      <h3>7. "It will eliminate private insurance."</h3>
      <p><span class="label">Concern:</span> People will lose choice in coverage.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Counter:</span> Many countries offer private supplemental insurance. Universal care guarantees a baseline, not restricts options.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Evidence:</span> In countries like France and Germany, private insurance coexists with universal coverage, offering additional services. <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2019/universal-health-coverage-eight-countries" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="reason">
      <h3>8. "It’s too expensive."</h3>
      <p><span class="label">Concern:</span> The U.S. can’t afford it.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Counter:</span> The U.S. already spends more per capita than any other nation. Universal care could reduce administrative costs and improve efficiency.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Evidence:</span> The U.S. spends significantly more on healthcare per capita compared to other developed countries, yet has worse health outcomes. <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/article/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="reason">
      <h3>9. "Government is inefficient."</h3>
      <p><span class="label">Concern:</span> Bureaucracy will ruin healthcare delivery.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Counter:</span> Private insurance is often more bureaucratic. Medicare has lower administrative costs than private companies.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Evidence:</span> Private insurance companies spend between 12 and 18 percent on administration costs, while Medicare's administrative costs are around 2 percent. <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/sep/20/bernie-sanders/comparing-administrative-costs-private-insurance-a/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="reason">
      <h3>10. "It will hurt doctors’ income and freedom."</h3>
      <p><span class="label">Concern:</span> Physicians will earn less and lose autonomy.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Counter:</span> Doctors in universal systems still earn well. Many prefer these systems due to less paperwork and more focus on patient care.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Evidence:</span> Physicians in countries with universal healthcare report high job satisfaction and competitive earnings. <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2023/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2022" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
