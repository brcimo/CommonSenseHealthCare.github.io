    <h2>You Can Keep Your Doctor Under CHS</h2>
    <p>
      CHS is designed so that patients can continue seeing the doctors, specialists, and clinics they rely on today.
      Most physicians and healthcare facilities already contract with multiple insurers and public programs, and CHS
      builds on that reality by allowing providers to participate directly in a single, streamlined system. This means
      that if your doctor practices in California and meets statewide clinical standards, they can see all CHS-covered
      patients without needing to change offices, move networks, or renegotiate multiple insurance contracts.
    </p>

    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Continuity of care:</strong> Long-term relationships between patients and clinicians are associated 
        with better health outcomes, fewer hospitalizations, and more appropriate use of medications and preventive 
        services.</li>

      <li><strong>Reduced administrative barriers:</strong> Providers spend less time dealing with insurer-by-insurer 
        paperwork, increasing the time they can spend on direct patient care.</li>

      <li><strong>More stable access:</strong> CHS eliminates the risk of losing access to your doctor due to job 
        changes, insurer withdrawals, employer plan switches, or premium increases.</li>

      <li><strong>Better coordination:</strong> Shared standards and a unified platform for health information allow 
        your doctor to communicate more easily with specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How CHS Makes This Possible</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All licensed providers in California who meet established quality and equity standards may participate.</li>
      <li>Payment rates, contracting, and billing are simplified and centralized through the CHS system.</li>
      <li>The Smart Health Access System (SHAS) keeps records and referrals consistent across all providers, reducing 
        delays and improving accuracy.</li>
      <li>Clinics and hospitals are encouraged to enroll because participation reduces administrative costs and expands 
        their ability to treat patients without coverage restrictions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The goal of CHS is to give every resident stable access to care without disrupting established patient-provider 
      relationships. Under the new system, your doctor can stay your doctor, and the entire process of receiving care 
      becomes simpler and more consistent for both patients and providers.
