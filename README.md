California Commonsense Healthcare System Proposal


Summary

The California Commonsense Healthcare System (CHS) aims to provide universal, high-quality healthcare for all residents of California. It guarantees access regardless of income or health status, eliminates insurance premiums and co-pays, negotiates lower drug costs, and reduces administrative overhead. The system will be implemented over four years and include a digital infrastructure called SHAS to support secure, integrated healthcare access and analytics.

For full transparency, the complete proposal includes provisions such as the establishment of a Board of Directors, employer contribution requirements, a phased implementation plan, the Smart Health Access System (SHAS), rules for private insurers, and a Patient Bill of Rights. The CHS will be funded through progressive payroll taxes and federal/state healthcare fund redirection without taxing low-income individuals.
