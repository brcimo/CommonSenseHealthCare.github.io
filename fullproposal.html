		<p><strong>California Commonsense Healthcare Proposal</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Section 1: Title</strong></p>
		<p>This act shall be known as the <strong>California Commonsense Healthcare System (CHS) Act</strong>.</p>
		<p><strong>Section 2: Purpose and Goals</strong></p>
		<p>The purpose of the California Commonsense Healthcare System is to ensure access to quality, affordable
			healthcare for all U.S. citizens and legal residents residing in California, without regard to income,
			health status, or other factors. The goals of the California Commonsense Healthcare System are as follows:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Provision of Comprehensive Health Coverage</strong>: Ensure that all U.S. citizens and legal
				residents of the state have access to a comprehensive health insurance plan that covers all necessary
				health services.</li>
			<li><strong>Net Savings</strong>: Achieve a net savings for all Californians by eliminating health insurance
				premiums, co-payments, and other out-of-pocket expenses.</li>
			<li><strong>Cost Control</strong>: Control the overall cost of healthcare through cost-saving measures,
				including reduced administrative expenses, increased system efficiency, and improved health outcomes.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Access to a Full Range of Services</strong>: Ensure the availability of a full spectrum of
				healthcare services, including preventive care, primary care, specialty care, hospitalization, dental,
				vision, mental health, prescription drug services, and long-term care. Long-term care shall include
				services such as skilled nursing, home-based care, assisted living, hospice, and other support services
				necessary for individuals with chronic illnesses, disabilities, or age-related needs.</li>
			<li><strong>High-Quality, Evidence-Based Care</strong>: Promote the delivery of high-quality, evidence-based
				healthcare services, with a focus on patient-centered, integrated, and coordinated care.</li>
			<li><strong>Minimization of Administrative Burdens</strong>: Reduce the administrative burden on both
				patients and healthcare providers.</li>
			<li><strong>Public Health and Wellness</strong>: Promote public health through prevention and wellness
				programs designed to improve the general health and well-being of the state's residents.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Section 3: Right to Healthcare</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Healthcare Access</strong>: All U.S. citizens and legal residents of California shall have the
				fundamental right to access comprehensive, high-quality healthcare services through the California

				services based on a resident&rsquo;s income, employment status, or health condition.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Section 4: Savings</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Expected Savings</strong>: The implementation of the California Commonsense Healthcare System is
				projected to result in significant long-term savings. This will be achieved by reducing the
				inefficiencies of the current fragmented healthcare system and improving overall health outcomes for
				California residents.</li>
			<li><strong>Negotiation of Drug Prices</strong>: The State shall negotiate directly with pharmaceutical
				companies to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, including establishing a bulk purchasing program to
				lower drug prices.</li>

				enhance the quality and accessibility of healthcare services and to ensure the financial sustainability
				of the California Commonsense Healthcare System.</li>

			<li><strong>Board of Directors</strong>: The California Commonsense Healthcare System shall be governed by a
				Board of Directors consisting of ninteen (19) members, initially appointed by the Governor and

		<p><strong>Section 13: Conclusion</strong></p>
		<p>The adoption of the California Commonsense Healthcare System will provide universal access to high-quality,
			affordable healthcare for all U.S. citizens and legal residents of California. This system will replace the
			existing fragmented healthcare structure with a more efficient, cost-effective model, ensuring that every
			resident receives comprehensive care without financial hardship. The California Commonsense Healthcare
			System aims to reduce administrative costs, promote public health, and ensure long-term sustainability while
			guaranteeing that all residents can access the care they need.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
		<p>The California Commonsense Healthcare System (CHS) Act proposes a universal, publicly administered healthcare
			system to provide comprehensive, high-quality care to all U.S. citizens and legal residents regardless of
			income or health status. It eliminates premiums and out-of-pocket costs, controls expenses through
			efficiency and negotiated drug prices, and ensures equal access across public and private providers. A
			phased four-year rollout includes a digital health ID system (SHAS) for streamlined care and data sharing.
			Private insurers may offer supplemental coverage but cannot exceed CHS costs. The system is funded through
			progressive payroll taxes and existing public funds, aiming for equity, cost savings, and improved health
			outcomes.</p>
