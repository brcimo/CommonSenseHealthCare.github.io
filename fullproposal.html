		<p><strong>California Commonsense Healthcare System Proposal</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Section 1: Title</strong></p>
		<p>This act shall be known as the <strong>California Commonsense Healthcare System (CHS) Act</strong>.</p>
		<p><strong>Section 2: Purpose and Goals</strong></p>
		<p>The purpose of the California Commonsense Healthcare System is to ensure access to quality, affordable
			healthcare for all residents of the State of California, without regard to income, health status, or other
			factors. The goals of the California Commonsense Healthcare System are as follows:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Provision of Comprehensive Health Coverage</strong>: Ensure that all residents of the state have
				access to a comprehensive health insurance plan that covers all necessary health services.</li>
			<li><strong>Net Savings</strong>: Achieve a net savings for all Californians by eliminating health insurance
				premiums, co-payments, and other out-of-pocket expenses.</li>
			<li><strong>Cost Control</strong>: Control the overall cost of healthcare through cost-saving measures,
				including reduced administrative expenses, increased system efficiency, and improved health outcomes.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Access to a Full Range of Services</strong>: Ensure the availability of a full spectrum of
				healthcare services, including preventive care, primary care, specialty care (including chiropractic
				services), hospitalization, dental, vision, mental health, prescription drug services, and long-term
				care. Long-term care shall include services such as skilled nursing, home-based care, assisted living,
				hospice, and other support services necessary for individuals with chronic illnesses, disabilities, or
				age-related needs.</li>
			<li><strong>High-Quality, Evidence-Based Care</strong>: Promote the delivery of high-quality, evidence-based
				healthcare services, with a focus on patient-centered, integrated, and coordinated care.</li>
			<li><strong>Minimization of Administrative Burdens</strong>: Reduce the administrative burden on both
				patients and healthcare providers.</li>
			<li><strong>Public Health and Wellness</strong>: Promote public health through prevention and wellness
				programs designed to improve the general health and well-being of the state's residents.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Section 3: Right to Healthcare</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Healthcare Access</strong>: All residents of California shall have the fundamental right to
				access comprehensive, high-quality healthcare services through the California Commonsense Healthcare
				System (CHS).</li>
			<li><strong>Non-Discrimination</strong>: The State shall not deny or limit the availability of healthcare
				services based on a resident&rsquo;s income, employment status, or health condition.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Section 4: Savings</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Expected Savings</strong>: The implementation of the California Commonsense Healthcare System is
				projected to result in significant long-term savings. This will be achieved by reducing the
				inefficiencies of the current fragmented healthcare system and improving overall health outcomes for
				California residents.</li>
			<li><strong>Negotiation of Drug Prices</strong>: The State shall negotiate directly with pharmaceutical
				companies to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, including establishing a bulk purchasing program to
				lower drug prices.</li>
			<li><strong>Utilization of Savings</strong>: Savings generated through these measures shall be used to
				enhance the quality and accessibility of healthcare services and to ensure the financial sustainability
				of the California Commonsense Healthcare System.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Section 5: Administration</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Board of Directors</strong>: The California Commonsense Healthcare System shall be governed by a
				Board of Directors consisting of seventeen (17) members, initially appointed by the Governor and
				confirmed by the California State Senate. After the full implementation of the California Commonsense
				Healthcare System, which shall occur after a four-year phase-in period, the Board shall be elected by
				the residents of California in a manner specified by the State Legislature.</li>
			<li><strong>Duties and Responsibilities</strong>: The Board of Directors shall be responsible for overseeing
				the implementation and operation of the California Commonsense Healthcare System, including but not
				limited to:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Setting quality standards and cost parameters.</li>
				<li>Negotiating contracts with healthcare providers.</li>
				<li>Ensuring the financial sustainability of the system.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>Board Composition and Terms</strong>:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>The Board shall consist of seventeen (17) members, who shall serve six-year terms, with a maximum of
					three (3) terms per member.</li>
				<li>Members of the Board may be compensated for their service.</li>
				<li>The Board shall initially consist of five (5) members, with the full complement of seventeen (17)
					members to be reached over a four-year period as follows:</li>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>After two years</strong>: An additional six (6) members shall be appointed.</li>
					<li><strong>After four years</strong>: An additional six (6) members shall be appointed.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Following the full implementation of the California Commonsense Healthcare System (end of the
					four-year phase-in period), all members of the Board shall be elected by the residents of
					California. The election process and rules for such elections shall be defined by the State
					Legislature and may include provisions for staggered terms, voter eligibility, and other necessary
					procedures to ensure representation and fair governance.</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Section 6: Implementation</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Key Design Considerations</strong>: The implementation of the California Commonsense Healthcare
				System shall be in accordance with the Key Design Considerations for a Unified Healthcare Financing
				System in California, as developed by the California Health and Human Services Agency, as outlined in
				the <strong>Final Report</strong> (available here: <a
					href="https://www.chhs.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Key-Design-Considerations_April-2022_Final-Report-for-Distribution.pdf">Key
					Design Considerations Report</a>).</li>
			<li><strong>Phase-in Period</strong>: The California Commonsense Healthcare System shall be phased in over a
				period of four (4) years, with the goal of complete coverage and a smooth transition for patients,
				healthcare providers, and employers. This phased implementation will include public education, outreach
				efforts, and the enrollment of eligible residents.</li>
			<li><strong>Specific Timelines</strong>:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Within ninety (90) days</strong> of passage, and lasting until full implementation:</li>

					<li>All Californians whose income is at or below 300% of the Federal Poverty Level shall be eligible
						for Medi-Cal at no cost.</li>
					<li>Employers who do not offer qualified health insurance to their employees will be required to pay
						an annual employment healthcare fee, as follows:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Employers with more than fifty (50) employees: $10,000 per employee.</li>
						<li>Employers with between ten (10) and forty-nine (49) employees: $8,000 per employee.</li>

							California Commonsense Healthcare System (CHS)</strong> shall be capped at $2,000. This cap
						does not apply to healthcare services covered under the CHS, as all covered services within the
						CHS will be provided at no cost to the individual after enrollment.</li>
				</ul>

				System (CHS) and all approved private insurance plans.</li>
			<li><strong>SHAS Access Options:</strong><br /> All residents shall be issued a secure <strong>California
					Health Access ID (CHAI)</strong>, available in both <strong>digital</strong> and
				<strong>physical</strong> formats:

						use, or emergencies.</li>
