    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The California Commonsense Healthcare System (CHS) Act creates a universal, publicly administered health coverage
      program for all U.S. citizens and legal residents living in California. It guarantees access to comprehensive
      services—including primary care, specialty care, hospitalization, dental, vision, mental health, prescription
      drugs, and long-term care—without premiums, co-pays, or out-of-pocket costs.
      <br><br>
      The Act aims to lower overall healthcare spending through reduced administrative waste, bulk drug price
      negotiations, and system-wide efficiency improvements. It establishes a nineteen-member governing board, initially
      appointed and later elected, to oversee standards, contracts, and financial sustainability. CHS will be phased in
      over four years, with expanded Medi-Cal eligibility, employer healthcare fees, and eventual full statewide
      coverage.
      <br><br>
      A central component is the Smart Health Access System (SHAS)—a universal digital health identity enabling
      real-time records, provider coordination, and streamlined billing across all CHS and approved private plans.
      Providers and insurers must integrate with SHAS and meet strict quality, equity, and transparency standards.
      <br><br>
      Private insurance remains allowed only for supplemental or parallel coverage, but cannot exceed CHS prices or
      limit patient access to public services. A new Insurance Utility Commission regulates private insurers, caps
      profits, and enforces consumer protections.
      <br><br>
      Funding comes from employer/employee payroll taxes above 200% of the federal poverty level, along with existing
      Medi-Cal, Medicare, and federal healthcare funds. No individual below 200% of the poverty level pays any tax or
      fee.
      <br><br>
      Overall, the CHS Act replaces California’s fragmented system with a unified, equitable structure designed to
      reduce costs, expand access, enhance care coordination, and ensure long-term sustainability for all residents.

    <h2>Full Proposal</h2>
    <p>
      For full transparency, the complete proposal includes provisions such as the establishment of a Board of
      Directors, employer contribution requirements, a phased implementation plan, the Smart Health Access System
      (SHAS), rules for private insurers, and a Patient Bill of Rights. The CHS will be funded through progressive
      payroll taxes and federal/state healthcare fund redirection without taxing low-income individuals.
