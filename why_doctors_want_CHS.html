    <h2>Why Doctors Benefit From CHS</h2>
    <p>
      The CHS system is designed not only to improve patient access, but also to strengthen the day-to-day experience of
      medical professionals. The current multi-insurer structure requires clinicians to manage complex billing rules,
      prior authorizations, variable reimbursement rates, and extensive documentation demands that differ from insurer
      to insurer. CHS replaces this fragmented environment with a unified, simplified structure that reduces overhead
      and allows physicians to focus more directly on clinical care.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Less Administrative Burden</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Under CHS, providers interact with a single statewide system instead of dozens of insurers, each with their
        own authorization rules and paperwork.</li>
      <li>Standardized billing, coding, and payment rules reduce administrative time and allow practices to operate with
        fewer non-clinical staff dedicated to insurance interactions.</li>
      <li>Predictable payment schedules help clinics plan budgets and reduce time spent on appeals or disputed claims.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. No Longer Working for Insurance Companies</h3>
    <p>
      Physicians currently spend a substantial portion of their workday navigating insurer requirements that influence
      which treatments are approved, how referrals are handled, and what services are reimbursed. CHS removes these
      insurer-imposed barriers by establishing statewide coverage standards. Doctors make treatment decisions based on
      clinical judgment rather than insurer authorization criteria, aligning care more closely with professional best
      practices.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Centralized Malpractice Coverage</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>CHS includes a publicly administered malpractice program that replaces the need for individual physicians or
        practices to negotiate private malpractice insurance.</li>
      <li>Centralized coverage reduces premium costs and removes the annual volatility associated with commercial
        malpractice markets.</li>
      <li>Uniform standards for credentialing, documentation, and claims processing create greater predictability and
        transparency for providers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Greater Clinical Freedom</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>With fewer billing restrictions and no insurer-specific cost-sharing rules, physicians can focus on
        professional judgment without worrying about which procedures or medications will be denied.</li>
      <li>Consistent coverage rules ensure that clinical guidelines—not insurance networks or plan types—drive patient
        care.</li>
      <li>Providers can engage in preventive, long-term, and chronic care management without concerns that coverage
        limits will disrupt treatment continuity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Reduced Claim Worries</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Because CHS operates as a unified payer, claims are processed through a single streamlined system designed to
        minimize disputes.</li>
      <li>Fewer denials and a simplified appeals process lower administrative overhead and reduce delays in payment.</li>
      <li>Clinicians spend less time defending routine claims or navigating inconsistent billing policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      By reducing administrative complexity, stabilizing malpractice coverage, and giving clinicians more control over
      treatment decisions, CHS aims to support a more sustainable and satisfying professional environment for
      California’s healthcare workforce. The system is built to strengthen clinical autonomy, reduce operational stress,
      and allow physicians to dedicate more time to patient care.
